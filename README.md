# ARIMA â€“ Predicting Spotify (SPOT) Stock Price

A time series forecasting project using the ARIMA (AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average) model to predict the stock price of Spotify (SPOT). The goal was to analyze historical stock data, build a forecasting model, and evaluate its ability to capture stock price trends.

## Project Overview

This project applies the ARIMA model to forecast Spotify stock prices based on past performance.  
The workflow included:

**Data Preparation:** Collected and cleaned historical Spotify stock price data.  
**Stationarity Check:** Used statistical tests and visualizations to confirm data suitability for ARIMA.  
**Model Selection:** Identified the best ARIMA(p, d, q) parameters through ACF/PACF plots and model tuning.  
**Forecasting:** Predicted future stock prices using the trained ARIMA model.  
**Evaluation & Visualization:** Compared predicted vs. actual values and plotted results to interpret model performance.

## Skills Demonstrated

**Time Series Analysis:** Worked with sequential financial data and tested for stationarity.  
**Forecasting Models:** Gained hands-on experience with ARIMA for stock price prediction.  
**Statistical Testing:** Applied ADF test and ACF/PACF plots to guide model selection.  
**Model Evaluation:** Compared forecasted prices with actual outcomes to measure performance.  
**Python Programming:** Strengthened skills in pandas, statsmodels, matplotlib, and numpy.

## Personal Takeaway

This project gave me a deeper understanding of how time series forecasting works in practice. I learned how to prepare and analyze financial data, choose the right ARIMA parameters, and evaluate forecast accuracy. Beyond the technical skills, it also helped me appreciate the challenges of predicting stock prices and the importance of combining statistical methods with domain knowledge in finance.
